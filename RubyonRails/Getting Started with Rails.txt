# You only need require calls for two use cases:
# To load files under the lib directory.
# To load gem dependencies that have require: false in the Gemfile.


% bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text
# This will create several files:
invoke  active_record
create    db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_articles.rb
create    app/models/article.rb
invoke    test_unit
create      test/models/article_test.rb
create      test/fixtures/articles.yml
# The two files we'll focus on are the migration file (db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_articles.rb) and the model file (app/models/article.rb).



6.2 Database Migrations

# Let's take a look at the contents of our new migration file:
% cat /Users/rajaniapple/rails-blog-app/blog/db/migrate/20231108232327_create_articles.rb

The call to create_table specifies how the articles table should be constructed. By default, the create_table method adds an id column as an auto-incrementing primary key. So the first record in the table will have an id of 1, the next record will have an id of 2, and so on.

Inside the block for create_table, two columns are defined: title and body. These were added by the generator because we included them in our generate command (bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text).

On the last line of the block is a call to t.timestamps. This method defines two additional columns named created_at and updated_at. As we will see, Rails will manage these for us, setting the values when we create or update a model object.

# Let's run our migration with the following command:

% bin/rails db:migrate
# The command will display output indicating that the table was created:
[
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :body

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
